                    <p class="hero"> In this 20 minute film adaptation of Stephen King's short story of the same name, a destitute hitchhiking college dropout meets the girl of his fantasies at a local diner, stirring up fury-fueled bloodlust that she seems to encourage, almost too completely.</p>
                    <p class="hero"><i>NONA</i>, written and directed by Riley Card and Shaun Rousso, tackles themes of ego, masculinity, and emotional entitlement through the lens of a disallusioned drifter seeking attachment. In a midwestern setting, Stephen King's cold-blooded murders are reinterpreted with a modern spin, cool cinematic tone, and captivating performance of lust–-and bloodlust.</p>
